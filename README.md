# Image-Sharing-App
A simple multi-user image sharing app in python. 

## Steps to start the app:
1. Run the server.py file in a terminal using python.
2. Run the client.py file in another terminal.
3. The app will open on running client.py

Note: The client.py can be in any folder but server.py needs to be in the same folder. Multiple instances of client.py can be opened at the same time. The app currently doesn't multi-device support. All the users need to be on the same device. Make sure that the 8080 port of your device is free before using the app.
